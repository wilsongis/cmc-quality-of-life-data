Median Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income in the Past 12 Months

### Why is this important?
The *Median Gross Rent as a Percentage of Household Income in the Past 12 Months* data is derived from B25071_001E. 

This measure divides the gross rent as a percentage of household income distribution into two equal parts: one-half of the cases falling below the median gross rent as a percentage of household income and one- half above the median. Median gross rent as a percentage of household income is computed on the basis of a standard distribution. Median gross rent as a percentage of household income is rounded to the nearest tenth. 

The 85 **Census Block Groups** (CBGs) that comprise the county are of unequal sizes. Typically, Block Groups have a population of 600 to 3,000 people.

### About the Data
The Census Block Groups (CBG) are calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Block groups are delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau to contain populations between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit of the Census for which reliable data is available.
