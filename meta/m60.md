## Work
Worked at Home

### Why is this important?
The *Worked at Home* data is derived from B99084_005E. 

The data on travel time to work were derived from answers to Question 34 in 2013 American Community Survey. This question was asked of people who indicated in 2013 ACS Question 29 that they worked at some time during the reference week, and who reported in 2013 ACS Question 31 that they worked outside their home. Travel time to work refers to the total number of minutes that it usually took the worker to get from home to work during the reference week. The elapsed time includes time spent waiting for public transportation, picking up passengers in carpools, and time spent in other activities related to getting to work. 

The 85 **Census Block Groups** (CBGs) that comprise the county are of unequal sizes. Typically, Block Groups have a population of 600 to 3,000 people.

### About the Data
The Census Block Groups (CBG) are calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Block groups are delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau to contain populations between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit of the Census for which reliable data is available.
