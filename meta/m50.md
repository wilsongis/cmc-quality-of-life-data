## Internet and Computers
No Internet Access

### Why is this important?
The *No Internet Access* data is derived from B28002_012E. 

The 2008 Broadband Improvement Act mandated the collection of data about computer and Internet use. As a result, three questions were added to the 2013 American Community Survey (ACS) to measure these topics. Data about computer and Internet use were derived from answers to Question 9, Question 10, and Question 11 on the 2013 ACS, and are asked of all occupied housing units.

The computer use question (Question 9) asked if anyone in the household owned or used a computer and included three response categories for a desktop/laptop, a handheld computer, or some other type of computer. Respondents selected a checkbox for "Yes" or "No" for each response category. Respondents could select all categories that applied.

No Internet access at this house, apartment, or mobile home- This category includes housing units where no one connects to or uses the Internet using a paid service or any free services.

The 85 **Census Block Groups** (CBGs) that comprise the county are of unequal sizes. Typically, Block Groups have a population of 600 to 3,000 people.

### About the Data
The Census Block Groups (CBG) are calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Block groups are delineated by the U.S. Census Bureau to contain populations between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Block groups are the smallest geographical unit of the Census for which reliable data is available.
